                        I am Dr. Sunanda N, a postdoctoral researcher at Universit√§t Hamburg with a strong background in ocean biogeochemistry and climate science. My research focuses on the complex interactions between atmospheric and oceanic processes, particularly in the North Indian Ocean. I hold a Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, where my thesis explored the impact of atmospheric and oceanic changes on net primary productivity.  
                        </p> <p className='mb-4'>
Over the years, I have contributed to multiple high-impact research projects, including studies on ocean carbon dynamics, tropical cyclone impacts, and coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling. My work has been published in leading scientific journals, and I have presented at prestigious international conferences such as AGU and OSICON.  
</p><p className='mb-4'>
Beyond research, I actively engage in science communication, mentoring, and early-career ocean professional networks. I am a life member of the Ocean Society of India and have been involved in initiatives such as the IOC-UNESCO Ocean Prediction DCC. My passion for ocean science extends to public outreach, where I contribute to LUCA Online Science Magazine.  
</p><p className='mb-4'>
With expertise in numerical modeling, data analysis, and interdisciplinary ocean research, I aim to advance our understanding of climate-ocean interactions and contribute to sustainable marine ecosystem management.
